# Bike-Sharing-Analysis
Goals:
To analyze and understand bike rental patterns in London, uncover the impact of weather and time-related factors on demand, and develop actionable insights for optimizing bike-sharing operations.
Business Needs:
Bike-sharing systems need data-driven insights to forecast demand, plan resource allocation, and improve customer satisfaction. This project focuses on identifying rental trends, peak usage periods, and environmental factors influencing bike-sharing services.
Process and Insights Discovery:
Data Gathering and Manipulation:
Cleaned and explored the London Bike Sharing dataset using Python to handle missing values, normalize data, and prepare it for analysis.
Conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover relationships between bike rentals, weather conditions, and time features.
Visualization and Insights:
Used Tableau to create dynamic visualizations, including:
Trend Analysis: Daily and hourly usage patterns, highlighting peak hours and seasonal variations.
Weather Impact: Visuals showing how factors like temperature, humidity, and wind speed influence bike rentals.
User Segmentation: Insights into customer behavior based on holidays, weekends, and weekdays.
Outcomes:
Discovered that warmer temperatures and lower humidity positively correlate with higher bike rentals.
Identified peak rental hours during morning and evening commutes on weekdays.
Highlighted the impact of holidays on reduced bike-sharing demand, informing better resource planning.
This project showcases proficiency in Python for data analysis and Tableau for storytelling, providing a comprehensive solution to optimize bike-sharing systems based on data-driven insights.
